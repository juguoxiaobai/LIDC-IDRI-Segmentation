The Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Image Database Resource Initiative (IDRI): A Completed Reference Database of Lung Nodules 
on CT Scans.  
This is the project for LIDC-IDRI segmentation that reference the method FCN-8s which have used on LV (Left Ventricle) Segmentation.  
The normal segmentation on digits platform need feature image folder and label image folder,but Sunnybrook LV Segmentation need image
folder and contour folder which used Sunnybrook plug-in.So, this project need a new plug-in like Sunnybrook aimed at LIDC-IDRI dataset.
